# Exploring Apps

Dione makes it easy to discover new apps. The main screen is divided into two sections: **Featured** and **Explore**.

## Featured

The **Featured** section showcases a curated list of apps recommended by the Dione team. This is a great place to start if you're looking for high-quality and popular applications.

## Explore

The **Explore** section provides a powerful search engine to find specific apps. You can search by name, category, or tag, and apply filters for platform, language, and more.
