# Installing an App

Dione automates the entire installation process, requiring no manual intervention.

## Select an App

Choose an app from the **Featured** or **Explore** sections. Once you've made your selection, click the **Install** button to begin the automatic installation.

## Installation Process

The installation screen provides real-time feedback. At the top right, you can monitor the installation status. The log window displays detailed information about the process:
-   <span class="text-blue-500">Blue lines</span> indicate important information.
-   <span class="text-yellow-500">Yellow lines</span> represent warnings.
-   <span class="text-neutral-400">Gray lines</span> provide additional details.

If an error occurs, a red box will appear with the error details, and the installation will stop.

Below the log, you'll find two buttons:
-   **Copy**: Copies the entire log to your clipboard.
-   **Stop**: Aborts the installation process.

## Completing the Installation

Once the installation is finished, Dione will automatically redirect you to the **Actions** screen, where you can start or uninstall the app.

If you are not redirected automatically, you will see an "Installation finished" message in the log. In this case, simply click the **Stop** button to clear the message and proceed to the **Actions** screen.

Now you're ready to [run the app](/user-guide/running-an-app).
