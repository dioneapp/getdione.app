# Installing a script

The installation of an app through Dione is fully automatic and requires no user intervention.

## Select the script

You can select the script from [Featured](/docs/scripts/featured) or [Explore](/docs/scripts/explore) sections. Once you have chosen your app, click **Install** to start the automatic process.

## Install the script

The interface is quite easy to understand, at the top right you have the installation status. Inside the box you will have all the information about what is happening, <span class="text-blue-500">the blue lines indicate important information</span>, <span class="text-yellow-500">the yellow lines warnings</span> and <span class="text-neutral-400">the gray lines additional information</span>.

If Dione encounters an error, a red box will appear with details and the installation will halt.

Below the log you’ll find two buttons: **Copy** (copies all logs) and **Stop** (aborts installation).

## Finish the installation

Once complete, Dione redirects you to the **Actions** screen where you can **Start** or **Uninstall** the script.

If you’re not redirected automatically, you’ll see a “Installation finished” message in the log—simply click **Stop** to clear it.

Now you can [start the app](/docs/scripts/running).
