# Building a script

This guide explains how to create a valid configuration file for execute applications on the **Dione** platform. The file should be written in JSON format and describe the required dependencies, installation steps, environment setup, and startup commands for the application.

---

## File Structure

The configuration file should follow this structure:

```json
{
  "dependencies": { ... },
  "installation": [ ... ],
  "start": [ ... ]
}
```

Each section is explained in detail below.

---

## Dependencies

This section lists all external dependencies that must be available before running the application. Dione will ensure these are installed or notify the user if missing.

### Format

* **Key**: the dependency name (e.g., `git`)
* **Value**: an object that specifies the version

### Example

```json
"dependencies": {
  "git": {
    "version": "latest"
  },
  "uv": {
    "version": "latest"
  }
}
```

You can specify a specific version like `"3.10"` instead of `"latest"` if needed.

---

## Installation

This section defines the steps required to install or set up the application after cloning the repository.

Each installation step should include the following fields:

- **`name`**: A human-readable description of the step.
- **`env`** (optional): Specifies the environment in which the commands should be executed.
  - Can be a simple string with the environment name.
  - Or an object with the following fields:
    - `name`: Name of the environment.
    - `type` (`uv` by default): Environment type, either `uv` or `conda`.
    - `version` (`latest` by default): Python version to use.
- **`commands`**: A list of commands to execute.
  - Can be simple strings (commands).
  - For platform-specific commands, use an object with:
    - `platform`: One of `windows`, `linux`, or `mac`.
    - `command`: The command string for that platform.

### Example

```json
"installation": [
  {
    "name": "Cloning repository",
    "commands": [
      "git clone https://github.com/myshell-ai/MeloTTS.git melotts"
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "Installing requirements",
    "env": {
      "name": "env",
      "version": "3.10",
      "type": "uv"
    },
    "commands": [
      "cd melotts",
      "uv pip install -e .",
      "python -m unidic download"
    ]
  }
]
```

When `env` is specified, all commands in that step will run within the given environment.
Dione will also add the dependency `uv` or `conda` (if you specify env.type `conda`) to the dependencies automatically, if it is not already specified.

---

## Environment Usage in Start

You can also specify which environment to use when launching your application in the `start` section.

### Example

```json
"start": [
  {
    "name": "Starting MeloTTS",
    "catch": "8888",
    "env": "env",
    "commands": [
      "cd melotts/melo",
      "uv run app.py --port 8888"
    ]
  }
]
```

* **`env`** in a `start` step refers to the environment by name (matching `env.name` in installation).
* Dione will activate this environment before running the commands.

---

## Start

This section defines how to launch the application after installation.

### Keys

* `name`: a description of the launch step
* `catch` (optional): a port number or keyword Dione can watch to detect that the app is running
* `env` (optional): the environment name to activate
* `commands`: same format as in the installation section

### Full Start Example

```json
"start": [
  {
    "name": "Starting MeloTTS",
    "catch": "8888",
    "env": "env",
    "commands": [
      "cd melotts/melo",
      "uv run app.py --port 8888"
    ]
  }
]
```

---

## Tips & Best Practices

* Use clear, descriptive `name` values for each step.
* Include `env` blocks for steps that require a specific interpreter or wrapper.
* Always include platform-specific commands where necessary.
* Use the `catch` key to help Dione detect when the application is ready.
* Test each command manually on each platform and environment.

## Full Example

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "git": { "version": "latest" },
    "uv": { "version": "latest" }
  },
  "installation": [
    {
      "name": "Cloning repository",
      "commands": [
        "git clone https://github.com/myshell-ai/MeloTTS.git melotts"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Installing requirements",
      "env": { "name": "env", "version": "3.10" },
      "commands": [
        "cd melotts",
        "uv pip install -e .",
        "python -m unidic download"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "start": [
    {
      "name": "Starting MeloTTS",
      "catch": "8888",
      "env": "env",
      "commands": [
        "cd melotts/melo",
        "uv run app.py --port 8888"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Create a folder called `melotts` and place the `dione.json` file inside it.

Now you can make a pull request to the [Official Dione Scripts](https://github.com/dioneapp/official-scripts) to add your application to the list of available applications.
